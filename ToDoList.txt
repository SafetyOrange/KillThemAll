TO DO 

/* Check it out, dog. I did some studying of the stupid, stupid target. Here's what I gathered about it, problems and all.
-The target's negative lerp will override collision on walls
-The closer you are to target, the less quickly it tries to avoid you (lerp logic)
-The target KEEPS it's current velocity while lerping.(If it's coming towards you quickly, it will avoid you slowly, not just cruise away. Its velocity needs to be neutralized.
-All of this being said, I don't think the target needs to avoid you anymore, just have its giveaways be visible and put it on a track. Maybe?

Collision 
Make target like certain environmental things
Playtest 
Interaction--attack, whatever you do to the target. 
Boss level--possibly black friday
